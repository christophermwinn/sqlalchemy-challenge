Module 10 Challenge

Attached is the submission for the Module 10 challenge, using SQLAlchemy and Flask.

The SurfsUp folder contains the submission, including the Jupyter notebook and app.py Python file.

The climate and station analysis sections were fairly straightforward and used many of the familiar Pandas elements.
The second portion, Design Your Climate App, required the new Flask skills learned in class to query the existing
sql database and return JSON lists for various data elements.  That portion was challenging and I'd like to work
on those skills going forward.
